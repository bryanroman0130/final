	<h1> Photoshop Designing </h1>
	<p> I have been designing on and off since middle school. I use a wide array of programs but my favorite is photoshop. Designing is a side job for me. I get paid to designing anything from youtube video thumbnails to logos and twitter banners. Basically anything. </p>

  <p> This is a link to my a song my friend made that I helped mix and produce. I know it is kind of a meme to promote music so I not advise to listen to it as it is "trap" music and has profanity. </p>
